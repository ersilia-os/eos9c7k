    "Description": "Given a molecule, this model for its 100 nearest neighbors, according to ECFP4 Tanimoto similarity, in the medicinal chemistry database ChEMBL17\\_DrugBank17\\_UNPD17. This combined database contains all the compounds from the three collections (DrugBank, ChEMBL22 and Universal natural product directory (UNPD)) with up to 17 heavy atoms. It features a total of 128k compounds. The whole ChEMBL17\\_DrugBank17\\_UNPD17 database is not downloaded with the model, by using it you post queries to an online server external to Ersilia.",
